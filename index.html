    <h1>Products to Purchase</h1>
    <p>If there is one space that has the maximum selling products, it is definitely this sector.</p>
    <div class="cat">
        <div class="high">
            <h1>STANDARD PURCHASE ORDER</h1>
            <p>A standard purchase order (PO) is created when the details of the required goods or services are known. Same as other purchase orders, this one is also a one-off procurement that has the complete set of specifications such as price and quantity with clearly defined payment and delivery timelines as well as location</p>
        </div>
        <div class="med">
            <h1>PLANNED PURCHASE ORDER </h1>
            <p>A planned purchase order is a long-term agreement committing to buy items or services from a single source. You must specify tentative delivery schedules and all details for goods or services that you want to buy, including charge account, quantities, and estimated cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="low">
            <h1>CONTRACT PURCHASE ORDER</h1>
            <p>Contract purchase orders are the most formal type of purchase order. For this type of order, the buyer and seller will have to sign a contract stating the purchase terms and conditions before a purchase order regarding the contract is issued. This type of purchase order presents the safest legal protection for both parties involved.</p>

    <p>I have 2 of these, one given as a gift, one bought myself, both of these have the same issue, the second I put my phone in my pocket, the connectivity starts to die and the audio starts to cut off and on or even if I cover my ears with my hand or just simply look away from my iPad screen for more than 2 seconds, and eventually disconnects after 10-15 mins of strugging</p>

  <p>After buying this, I'm gonna stay far clear from pTron, as I had another family member who bought a 3 ended(Micro USB + C + Lightning) braided pTron cable and the braid tore off revealing the white plastic cable inside, and cheap TWS earphones, I had a RealMe Buds Neo(this one didnt have bluetooth connectivity issues but as these were 2k so I ain't comparing) too in 2020,</p>
